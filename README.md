# Ty Logs

[Ty Logs Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRVkUK12VKfajXxah6lCrrg) This is where all the larger, more artistically driven videos are posted.

This is a public billboard about what I am working on, my progress in it, and what I have planned in the future. All the resources used to make my videos are linked in their respective scripts. 

I like to be transparent and provide these resources so that if you want to try your hand at something I do you know a place to start.
