[Ty Logs Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRVkUK12VKfajXxah6lCrrg) This is where all the larger, more artistically driven videos are posted.

[Ty Logs TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@ty_logs) This is where I post most frequently, asking for input or giving more frequent updates on projects.


This is a public billboard about what I am working on, my progress in it, and what I have planned in the future. All the resources used to make my videos are linked in their respective scripts. 

I like to be transparent and provide these resources so that if you want to try your hand at something I do you know a place to start.
