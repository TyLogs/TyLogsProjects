Make picture frames for printed film photos.
Possible things to make it a bit more interesting:
- Use different wood types
- Use Scrap wood
- A frame that houses multiple photos
- Learn to cut glass
- make a glassless frame

Or all of them at once (Probably not ALL, but combining a few of these would be good.)
