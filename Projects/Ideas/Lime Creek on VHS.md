Go to Lime Creek road and take a bunch of VHS footage of the cool cars on my VHS camera

###### Intro Idea
Start with my normal camera for the ride there, do a cool transition into the VHS camera
- behind a pole transition
- Look into the sky transition (crossfade)
- crossfade into VHS
- make a little plot point of setting it up and cut into music and VHS footage
Maybe Interview people about their cars.
