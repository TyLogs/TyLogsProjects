#### Script

**The Camera**
This is a Sony Mavica FD87. Released in 2001, it was the fourth generation of the **Mavica** digital family to store its images on a 3.5" Floppy Disk. (We'll get to that later).
**Features**
First of all, hard plastic body, and given that it's been around for 23 years at this point, it's in remarkable condition. It's a very unique looking camera, you'd be hard pressed to find someone carrying around a similar camera in your day to day life.
The Plastic construction allows for it to be pretty reliable for day to day use. And, as an added bonus, all the visible screws are Philips heads, with small arrows telling you how to take it apart. Talk about right to repair right? (Mention the zoom switch, and flash as well)
There's a LCD screen as your viewport, with a switch to turn the backlight on and off. Not completely sure why, but if you shine light through the top you can still technically use it. (Maybe to use this when the sun is out? Not sure tho.) 
Alright, lets power this guy on.
So first things first, battery life. The battery that this came with is fine and according to the display, would give me about an hour of battery life. Using that, and remembering to turn it off between pictures, I could make it last about a day, which is pretty amazing for a 23 year old battery. I bought some replacement batteries however, and have very easily gotten a week plus of usage using the same method, depending on how often I used it, with the display stating around 300 minutes or 5ish hours of total battery life. 

You can see these 4 buttons at the bottom for different features as well as this D-pad selector type thingy. (Explain each of the 4 buttons)
If you hit up on the selector, it brings up a menu with plenty of options and amazing noises and beeps and boops. you can change the resolution (Max of 1280x960), some filters, if you want a date on the photo. 

There are some drawbacks though, to buying a 20 dollar camera off of ebay. For 1, the resolution is low, which I don't see as a bad thing, but it is something to keep in mind. second, although in my mind this makes it cooler, it does store its images on Floppy disks, allowing for anywhere between 6-10 photos per disk. That's less than you can get on an average film roll. Again, I see this as a positive, but I've always been a glass half full type of guy.

Undoubtedly, this camera has a certain charm to it that I absolutely love. From loading in the floppy disks, the low resolution and little red dates at the bottom of the camera, beeps and boops as you navigate the menu, I think are wonderful. this, combined with its decently small form factor, and low quantity of images, it gives a really great budget alternative to a film camera, given that the camera, Floppy disk adapter, and floppy disks are all one time purchases (Usually, floppy disks are notoriously hit and miss with there reliability, but you still would be buying them less that film) for a college student like me, it makes it a pretty awesome gadget to have around.
