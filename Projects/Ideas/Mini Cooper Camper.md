Convert my 2013 Mini Cooper Clubman into a tiny camping vehicle

- Must be removable (Non Permanent)
- Must be CHEAP, EASY, and ACCESSABLE

## Current Plan

- Get a Roof Rack (Optional)
- Build platform so I can sleep in it
- Window Blocker things
- Figure out how to camp in it
- Go on a Camping Trip to test it out


#### Intro
*Standing in front of the car*
This is my 2013 Mini Cooper Clubman, That I intend on turning into a fully functional mini camping vehicle. 

Your fist question might be, "Why on earth would you convert a MINI of all vehicles?" Well, on this channel we are all about doing things on a budget, not by choice tho.

*Standing by the back of the car* 
So what space do we have to work with in the car?
Different from other Minis, the Clubman actually comes equipped with Barn doors out the back, and seats that fold down flat, so we have a decent amount of cargo space to work with. There is also nice pockets in the doors, as well as storage under the floor.
*cinematic shots of the door pockets, putting the seats down, opening small "floor" storage*

*Footage of me getting in and curling up in a ball*
This is not enough room to actually sleep in the car, unless we curled up into the fetal position, which is not what I would like to do. 

*Side shot of the car, open the door and Do, demonstrate being able to lay down with the seat pushed forward*
If we come over to the passenger side, we can see another unique feature of this car, what I call the Do. What is a do? well its half of a door. this, combined with front seats that fold down as well, provides a surprising amount of space in this car, and would allow us to lay down horizontally.

Now that we have a designated are for sleeping, we need a place to put all our camping gear. We of course have the designated cargo areas that come with the car, but if we want to actually go camping, we will need a bit more space.

First we have the half that we are not sleeping on in the trunk area, where we can build a small shelving system to hold cargo

There will be space under the platform that we will build, where we can get pretty good access to from the Do

And of course we have the passenger footwell, or at least what's left of it.



##### Designing 

- Need to take inventory of the camping gear I have, shape, size, etc, and design shelves for the back around that. 
- Print out photos and draw directly on them with a camera filming
