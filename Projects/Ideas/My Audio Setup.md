# Draft 1

You don't need everything to start enjoying something.

I have always been a music lover, and about a year ago I wanted to be more intentional about how I listen to my music. 
It started off small, with downloading my entire music library on Spotify, and setting my playback quality to very high.
My research eventually lead me to realize a few things.
Its called "Hi-Fi"
Spotify is not usually used for Hi-Fi
I was likely not listening to my music at the highest quality because I was not using particularly good headphones
Analog is fantastic.

###### What is "HiFi"?
Hi-Fi, is the short term for High Fidelity, which is a term coined in the 40's and 50's, and drastically simplified is methods used for high quality sound reproduction, with a particular emphasis on reproducing a sound that has as faithful of a representation of the original source as possible.

###### Why I'm doing it wrong (Not Really)
According to my research, there were two things that made me a "fake" Hi-Fi enthusiast.
1. I use Spotify
2. Equipment Bottle-necking
Spotify, is NOT the Hi-Fi enthusiasts pick for a streaming service. Most Hi-Fi people recommend Apple Music or Amazon Music for streaming purposes, as both services offer lossless audio for compatible music.

Besides my preferred streaming service not being the service of choice for Hi-Fi enthusiast, I am also limited by the quality of my headphones and speakers. You can have the largest, most detailed, highest quality audio file on the planet, but if you are using cheap headphones or earbuds, its not gonna matter. 

However, I do not plan on being a super particular, die hard Hi-Fi audio enthusiast, for a number of reasons, my main one being that equipment can get very expensive. A lot of people don't realize that it's okay to be a surface level enjoyer of something, and it doesn't mean you are a "fake fan" or anything like that. People have access to different resources and things, and if the passion is there, then that's all that matters. 

On that note, I decided not to switch my streaming service, as Spotify works very well for me. I enjoy the cross device functionality, the way it recommends new music, and I don't have to pay for it as I'm part of my family plan. Money saved.
Either way, even with Spotify I have noticed more detail and a bump in quality purely from equipment I have bought (more on that later). 
Instead, I plan on slowly accumulating high quality audio files over time, at a pace that is comfortable for my budget. I see people talk highly about ripping audio files from CD's, as you can get some very high quality from them, and there are a number of distributors that sell high quality audio. You can also find High quality music files on Internet Archive.
###### Analog and Tangible is Awesome
Hi-Fi enthusiasts RAVE about analog music (Except for Cassette tapes, but I still collect them because they are cheap and fun to make mixes with).
As mentioned before, CD's are an extremely accessible high quality format to listen to music, and Vinyl Records are as analog as you can get, and can produce amazing results on some pretty accessible hardware. 

#### My Journey
###### Pioneer CS-G103 Speakers
My journey started when my dad gave me some pioneer CS-G103 speakers. Now, I didn't know much about these speaker when I first got them, but my immediate reaction was "Damn these are some real speakers, and I need to figure out a way to use them", which led me to my next purchase. 
###### Moukey Mini Amp
This was the first purchase I made, which allowed me to Bluetooth connect to my speakers. It was like 10 dollars on amazon, and was already sounding better and louder than my headphones and other Bluetooth speakers.
###### Technics M222 Cassette Deck ($60)
The Moukey also had one RCA input to support another source besides Bluetooth or USB, and since I already has some cassettes lying around I figured a Tape deck would make a great addition. After searching eBay for a few months, I found a good deal on this Technics M222 Cassette Deck, that was tested, working, and had a 30-day return policy. 
###### Toshiba SB-M36 Amplifier ($120)
Right around when I got my tape deck working, I was starting to research more into what makes a good Hi-Fi setup, and I started to want the ability to play All forms of music that I could find, and to be able to switch between multiple sources, so the Moukey mini amp with one source was not going to cut it. I searched eBay again for a  "Hi-fi" "Multi-Channel" "Used" "Tested" amplifier, that also looked cool. I ended up finding this Toshiba SB-M36 Amp, which had enough inputs for everything I was wanting eventually add to my setup, was "Vintage Hi-Fi", and looked pretty sweet. Plugging it in and testing it I did notice a bump the quality of the music, plus I had more control over how it sounded
###### Sony PS-LX310BT
As I started expressing interest, my family took notice and I was gifted this Sony PS-LX310BT record player for Christmas. Thanks Mom and Dad :)



##### Conclusion
All these upgrades were over the span of a about a year, and I made sure to budget and plan for them accordingly (except for the gifts of course). However, you can get a sweet record player for under $200, and a decent set of speakers to go with it for under $100. You can also get amplifiers that cost more than a car, with speakers that could be sold to pay for the rest of my college education. You can also be completely content with getting nice headphones or IEM's (In Ear Monitors) to pair with your phone or whatever else you listen to music on. There are so many options it could be overwhelming, so do your research and do what works best for you!


# Being a "Fake Fan"

Hobbies should be fun 
Scratch that,
Hobbies ARE fun.

On that topic, is it possible to enjoy something...

*Incorrectly?*
