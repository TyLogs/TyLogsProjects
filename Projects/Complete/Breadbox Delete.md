**"Removing Safety Features from my car (For Fun)"**

##### Thumbnail Ideas:

##### Talking points

Mostly going to be going through the process. Only part scripted will likely be the intro.

**Intro:**

The 80's were a magnificent time, with some of cultures greatest regrets, including mullets, leg warmers, and some of the most uncomfortable workout tapes you have ever seen. But fortunately for ME it was also a bustling time for cars, Especially in regard to safety features such as Airbags, and traction control, which were becoming more and more commonplace. These inventions have gone on to save millions of lives in the modern day.

My car has none of that.

This is my 1985 Chevrolet corvette. It has No Airbags, No Traction Control, No ABS system, and a V8 engine. In place of what WOULD have been an airbag, to show you that they at least thought about it, we have this cushion, most commonly referred to as the "Breadbox". It is the only thing in-between my passenger, and whiplash.

Today we are going to remove it, because I think it looks funny.
