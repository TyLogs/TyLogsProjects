Overall, was a fun build, even though I had to work on it between classes and college application stuff. It certainly isn't perfect, but I think that add a sort of charm to it. (Or I am completely and utterly biased because I am the one who built it)

Things that didn't go exactly as planned:

The Keyboard ended up not working, had to buy a tiny off the shelf one. Not the worst, but it looks a but funky

Had to cut the screen case a little bit to see the whole screen. Looks pretty good except for the top right corner. Hand slipped and I cut to far.
