Heavily Inspired by the Posy Videos, cinematic shots of me opening up and repairing my Sony Tape Recorder

Describe the Recorder (B-roll, some still shots)

Demonstrate the problem (Close up of pressing button, and showing no spinning of the little thingies)

Unscrew back (Tripod Shot)

Clean discs (Close up of tweezers)

Show new belt (Throw new belt at it)

Put new belt on (Use tweezers to put rubber belt on)

Test it with back off to see if it spins (Same shot as before)

Play Lionel Richie (Cinematic of me putting a tape in)
- Shot of the speaker on the back, as Lionel Richie fades from raw speaker audio into a higher quality version, and go to credits. Maybe a little zoom out as it plays
