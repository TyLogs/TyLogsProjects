#### What I Learned
- Go through and name the footage I take before editing, makes it significantly easier to edit.
- Sync footage with audio captured with audacity (if applicable) FIRST so you have more room to work with. I can then link the audio and video together for easy maneuvering. 

#### Song Possibilities
- Bohemia after dark - Cannonball Adderley
- In The twilight - SOIL & "PIMP" SESSIONS
- **Remember - Hank Mobley**
